# Components

Reusable UI components organized by usage context.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Reusable UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- `parent/` - Parent-mode specific components
- `child/` - Child-mode specific components
- `shared/` - Components used in both modes

Components will be created as needed in Epic 2-6.
